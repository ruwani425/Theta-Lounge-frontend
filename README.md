I have updated the README code to include your two new screenshots. I've placed the Landing Page at the top of the Client Interface section (as it's usually the first thing people see) and added the Services page to the grid.

Since you now have 5 client-side images, I have organized them into a 3+2 layout to keep the grid looking balanced and professional.
